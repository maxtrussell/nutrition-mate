**TLDR:**

- Calories: [TDEE Calculator](/tdee)
- Fat: 78g
- Carbs: 275g
- Protein: 50g or, if you're looking to build muscle, 0.8g protein per pound of body weight
- Fiber: 28g
- Sugar: 50g
- The carb/fat split isn't too important. Get your calories right and if you're trying to build muscle, your protein as well

An important aspect of eating healthy is knowing how much of what to eat each day. Fortunately there are some relatively simple methods to determine your daily nutritional targets!

### Calories

The first, and most important, nutrient to track is Calories. Your weight is almost entirely determined by how many Calories you consume and how many Calories you burn each day. You're likely already aware of the FDA recommendation of 2000 calories a day. The issue is that this number is affected by a number of individual factors such as gender, weight, age, activity level, etc. These factors mean that the 2000 calories/day recommendation is a bit too general to be useful to the individual.

Ok, so how do we find out how many calories someone needs per day?

This brings us to the concept of Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE for short). TDEE is the measure of total Calories that your body uses per day. If the number of Calories you eat every days matches your TDEE, you will remain the same weight. This is because your body would not have any extra energy to store into fat and would also not need to break down any fat for energy.

Your TDEE can be calculated with this equation:

```
TDEE = BMR * (activity level modifier)
```

BMR is your Basal Metabolic Rate, or the number of Calories your body needs to remain functioning at rest. As shown in the equation above, combining your BMR with your activity level will give you the number of Calories you need to maintain your weight.

If you're looking to change your body weight, then there is one more fact worth knowing.

```
1 pound of body weight ~= 3500 Calories
```

So for instance, if your TDEE was 2200 Calories per day, and you wanted to lose 1 pound every week, here is how you would calculate your daily Calorie target:

```
Target = TDEE + (Calories per pound * weekly weight loss goal / 7 days)
Target = 2200 + (3500 * -1 / 7)
Target = 2200 - 500
Target = 1700 Calories/day
```

Here is a handy calculator for your BMI, TDEE, and daily calorie targets: [TDEE Calculator](/tdee)

### Protein

The FDA recommendation for daily protein intake is 50g a day. This is perfectly adequate if your goal is to be healthy and not gain much muscle mass. However, consuming only 50g of protein per day could end up becoming a bottleneck if you wish to build more muscle.

In order to maximize muscle gains, you want to ensure that protein is not a limiting factor. Research suggests that the ideal protein intake for muscle building is [0.82g/lb or 1.8g/kg](https://mennohenselmans.com/the-myth-of-1glb-optimal-protein-intake-for-bodybuilders/).

### Everything Else

For the remainder of the nutrient recommendations, I defer to the FDA's guidelines, layed out [here](https://ods.od.nih.gov/Health_Information/Dietary_Reference_Intakes.aspx).

Utimately everything comes out to:

- Fat: 78g
- Carbs: 275g
- Fiber: 28g
- Sugar: 50g

When it comes to weight gain/loss, the number of calories dictates your results. And when it comes to body composition, exercise and protein intake dictates the outcome. Considering these facts the carb/fat split isn't too important. Get your calories right and if you're trying to build muscle, your protein as well.
